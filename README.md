### What is libft?
Libft is an individual project at [UNIT Factory][2] that requires us to re-create some standard C library functions including some additional ones that can be used later to build a library of useful functions for the rest of the program.

Disclaimer: *Reinventing the wheel is bad, UNIT Factory makes us do this just so we can have a deeper understanding of data structures and basic algorithms. At UNIT Factory we're not allowed to use some standard libraries on our projects, so we have to keep growing this library with our own functions as we go farther in the program.*

### What's in it?

There are 4 sections:

1.  **Libc Functions:** Some of the standard C functions.
2.  **Additional functions:** Functions will be useful for later projects.
3.  **Bonus Functions:** Functions will be useful for linked list manipulation.
4.  **Personal Functions:** Functions I believe will be useful later.

### How does it work?

The goal is to create a library called libft.a from the source files so I can later use that library from other projects at UNIT.

To create that library, after downloading/cloning this project, **cd** into the project, call make:

	git clone https://github.com/denyspanov/libft-c-42
	cd libft-c-42
	make

You should see a *libft.a* file and some object files (.o).


Now to clean up (removing the .o files and the .c files from the root), call `make clean`.

Enjoy.
